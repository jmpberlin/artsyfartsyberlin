# artsyfartsyberlin

"ArtsyFartsy" is a little basic online-shop, I build to sell analog-darkroom-prints, that I made during this year. 
It's made with the MERN-Stack and deployed on Heroku. You can find it here: artsyfartsyberlin.herokuapp.com

The Styling I have done with Tailwind, which looks very weird, if you are not used to it. But I wanted to try another way of styling my App and particularly for giving a quick responsive layout, while building the components, it works pretty good! 

For Payment-Checkout I implemented Stripe as an external service. 

FYI: this app is my first React-App I started building 5 weeks ago and it is an ongoing work in progress!
