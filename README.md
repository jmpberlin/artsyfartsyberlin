# artsyfartsyberlin

"ArtsyFartsy" is a little basic online-shop, I build to sell analog-darkroom-prints, that I made during this year.
It's made with the MERN-Stack and deployed on Heroku. You can find it here: artsyfartsyberlin.herokuapp.com

The Styling I have done with Tailwind and it's so far only optimized for mobile and still looks weird on bigger screens.

For Payment-Checkout I implemented Stripe as an external service.

FYI: this app is my first React-App I started building 5 weeks ago and it is an ongoing work in progress!
